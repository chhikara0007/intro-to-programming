# Front-End Path Intro
## Why Take This Course?
Today, front-end developers work with web designers to create the interactive experiences that make the web the addictive playground we know and love. As the size and influence of the web has expanded, so has the importance of ensuring a website offers users an unforgettable experience.  

Perhaps your end goal is to create a HTML5 game, code the front-end for an app idea you have, or maybe you want to use one of the growing set of libraries that let you compile code written in another language or for another platform down to JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can do all these things and more.

## JavaScript Tips and Tricks
### JavaScript
Whether you want to add dynamism and interactivity to your applications, or to start creating remote APIs in languages other than the more traditional PHP, Python, and Ruby, you’ll be well served by learning JavaScript.  

In addition to the course you are about to take, check out the [JavaScript basics documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/JavaScript) on the Mozilla Development Network (MDN). There you’ll find additional resources about instantiating variables, including scripts, data types, commenting, operators, and more.  

You might find it useful to familiarize yourself with the jQuery and Node.js documentation. These will lead you in the right direction towards becoming a professional JavaScript developer.  

Because JavaScript is constantly changing, evolving, and growing, you’ll also need to keep up-to-date with the latest trends. To do that, sign up for [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/), a free email round-up of JavaScript news and articles. That way, you’ll stay in tune with where the language and the industry are headed.  

Like any dynamic, growing, vibrant language, JavaScript is always moving. It can be a challenge to stay on top of all the latest changes, but to make great web applications, it’s a must!  

With additional resources under your belt, let's get started!
