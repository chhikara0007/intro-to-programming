## Where to Focus Your Attention
In the next few videos Dave Evans, the instructor for most of this course, will give an overview of Introduction to Computer Science, the course that this one samples from.  

Some of what he discusses will not apply to what you will learn in this course, but a lot of it will.  

### You can ignore...
- The references to "building a search engine". You won't be doing that in this Nanodegree Program.
- His descriptions of the different "Units" in the course. We won't be following the exact same order.

### You should pay attention to...
- What Dave says about **breaking problems into smaller pieces**.
- How Dave talks about computers, computer programs, and the web.

## Focus Checkpoint
In the next few videos, Dave will explain what programming is and why it's such a powerful tool.

He will use terms like:

- computer
- program
- precise sequence of steps
- computation
- high-level language
- input
- interpreter

Some of these you have heard of, some you probably haven't. Pay attention to these terms as Dave uses them. **Try to use context to guess what they may mean.** You'll probably find that even the words you're familiar with (like "computer") are used slightly differently.

## What is Programming
And the power of the computer, is that, unlike a toaster, which is only designed to do a fwe things, a computer can do anything.  
A computer is a universal machine. We can program it to do essentially any computation.  
So anything that we can imagine, anything that we can figure out how to write a program for, we can make the computer do.  
And what the program needs to be is a very precise sequence of steps.  
So we can turn the computer into a web browser, into a server, into a game-playing machine, into a toaster, without anywhere to put the bread.  
But it can do anything we can imagine: at least any computation we want to do.  
The power of the computer is that it can execute the steps super super fast. So we can execute billions of instructions in one second.

## What Dave Just Said
In the answer video for the previous quiz, Dave said  

"The programs you'll write in this class will be Python code. Those will be input to **another** program which is a Python interpreter that follows the instructions in your code and it does that by following the instruction in its code... and you'll be able to run all that using your web browser."  

Hidden in these two sentences are examples of 3 of the 5 ways you can think like a programmer:

- The line "...follows the instructions in your code..." references the **procedural thinking** required of programmers.
- The entire quote demonstrates a deep **technological empathy** (which you don't need to have at this point) for how computers and programs work.
- When Dave thinks of a Python program, a Python interpreter, and a web browser as different versions of the same thing (a computer program) he's showing **abstract thinking**.

Now you're about to write your very first computer program. Don't worry if it doesn't work as expected to begin with, computer programs often don't!

## What's Next (a Warning)
First, congratulations again! Writing your first computer program is a big deal!   

Now, I want to give you a warning: the next few videos and quizzes are highly theoretical. They have titles like "Language Ambiguity" and "Backus Naur Form" and they go over a lot of material pretty quickly. You may find yourself overwhelmed.  

That's okay. You don't need to remember any of it. I've decided to include these videos for three reasons:

- When I took this course, I found this theoretical side of programming very interesting and I suspect other students will too (even if it isn't too useful at this point).
- There's a difference between computer **programming** and computer **science and** this is a great example of what it means to do **computer science**.
- **Gaining exposure to these ideas is helpful even if you don't master them.**

So watch these videos and attempt the quizzes. But don't worry if you feel confused. You can move on in the Nanodegree and you'll be absolutely fine.

## The Rest of the Lesson
You made it through the extremely technical stuff. Good job and don't worry if it didn't sink in.  

If you **did** enjoy that segment, you may be interested in learning more about pure **Computer Science** when you complete this Nanodegree. Check out the Instructor Notes below for recommended courses.  

Now, enjoy the last few segments of the lesson! The example Dave uses for the rest of the lesson involves some pretty intense arithmetic. If you're a bit rusty with math, try not to focus on the details of the calculations. Instead, focus on...

- the difference between 1 and 1.0 in Python.
- **the incredible things that computers can do (and their speed!)**

If you really enjoyed the previous few segments, you may enjoy some of Udacity's more theoretical courses. Consider taking any of the following after this Nanodegree:

- [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101?_ga=1.241929030.53639439.1458784522): the course that this course samples from
- [Programming Languages](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs262?_ga=1.241929030.53639439.1458784522): more about the nitty gritty of what programming languages are
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs215?_ga=1.245064641.53639439.1458784522): a mathematical approach to thinking about programming
- [Intro to Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs313?_ga=1.245064641.53639439.1458784522): explores questions like "what makes a problem hard?"

## Speed of Light

If you find you are getting 0 when you run your code, try changing the values to decimals.  

When you divide an integer (number without a decimal) by another integer, Python does something called **integer division** which means it **ignores the decimal part of the answer**. For example, **5/2 gives 2 instead of 2.5**, and 1/10 gives 0 instead of 0.1.  

To f**orce Python to give you an answer including a decimal**, you need to **make one of the numbers into a decimal by putting a decimal point after it**. For example, **5/2.0 gives 2.5, and so does 5.0/2**. Try experimenting in the interpreter so that you get a feel of how it works.
