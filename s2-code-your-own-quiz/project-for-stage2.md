# Project for Stage2
## Project Submission

In this stage, you will use the Python programming language to build your own quiz. You will use a fill-in-the blank style to create a quiz that can even be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.

### 1 - Game Review
In this portion of the review, your reviewer will be checking to make sure the game works the way it's supposed to. See the rubric below for exact specs.

### 2 - Code Review
Your reviewer will also look at the Python code you've written and provide feedback on:

- Use of Variables: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable names should reflect the values they store.
- Functions: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.
- Appropriate use of Data: Data types (strings vs lists for example) should be used appropriately.
- Appropriate use of other coding techniques: Your code should use statements like if, then, else, while, etc... appropriately.
- Each function includes a comment: Comments explain function behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable.)
