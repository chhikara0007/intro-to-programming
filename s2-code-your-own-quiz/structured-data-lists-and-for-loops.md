## Focus Checkpoint
You now know a bit about how to use lists. Now you're going to learn about how they actually work.  

The two concepts you'll encounter are called **mutation** and **aliasing**. Understanding them will help you avoid hours of unnecessary frustration in the future.

### Why What You Just Learned Matters
When I first took this lesson, I found myself saying "I don't care how all this works! Just show me how to use it!"  

I was frustrated by what felt like unnecessary details about how Python works. But now I really appreciate that Dave included this in his course.

**Learning how technology actually works is how you build your technological empathy**. This empathy will help you diagnose and fix bugs that otherwise would have been a mystery to you.  

For example, sometime in the future you will be writing a program and you will find that a variable does not have the value you expected. The cause may be that you changed the value of a variable that you thought was different but actually wasn't (due to the **aliasing** you just learned about).  

And now, you'll be able to fix that problem. And you know a bit more about how Python works!

## Focus Checkpoint
### What You Learned
Dave just explained a lot about how Python works. Before you continue, take a minute to think about (and write summaries of) the following concepts:

- Structured data
- Mutability
- The difference between append and +

### What You Will Learn
One of the advantages of having data with structure (like in a list) is that you can **take advantage of that structure**! One way you can do that is by directly looping through the elements of a list with what's called a **for loop**.  

You're going to learn about for loops after a brief reminder of while loops.
