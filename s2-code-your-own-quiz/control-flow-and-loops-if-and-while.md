# Control Flow & Loops: If and While

## Where to Focus Your Attention
### What You Will Learn
In this lesson you will get a chance to practice your **procedural thinking** as you learn two new important programming tools: **decision making and repetition.**  

In the first part of the lesson, you'll learn how to use ```if``` statements to **control which code gets executed when**.  

In the second part, you'll learn how to use ```while``` loops to make code that **performs the same task many times**.

### What Will be Hard
In this lesson you won't just learn new concepts, you'll actually build on top of two of the big concepts you've already learned a bit about: **variables** and **functions**.  

One thing that will probably be hard about this lesson is this:  

It's hard to build on shaky foundations and your foundations are probably still shaky.  

What does this mean for you?  

**Go slow. Rewind and replay things that are confusing. Ask questions on the forum. Appreciate the fact that your brain is processing a lot of new information!**  

Remember that **you don't need to remember everything** and **even the things that are important don't have to be fully internalized now**.

## Focus Checkpoint
Dave is about to ask you a hard, seemingly-pointless question. He's going to ask you to write a function which takes in three numbers and returns the biggest.  

You may be thinking Why? Who cares what the biggest number is?  

The reason you're being asked to do this is because this question is really meant to **get you practicing not just how to use if and else but how to think procedurally**.  

You could easily look at 3 numbers and point out which is biggest, but telling a computer how to do that isn't so simple.  

I would recommend trying to solve this question on paper (without writing actual code) before writing Python code.  

## Biggest Solution

The import thign to see here is that we can define procedures ourselves.  
And, in fact, we've seen enough at this point that every build-in procedure in Python, you could actually define yourself.  
And it's even better that that, that you actually know enough at this point, that **you could write every possible computer program, using just the things that we've seen.**  
And this is a pretty astounding result, and I mean this in a very strong sense, that everything that could be computed mechanically by any machine can be described using a program that only used the things that we've seen so far.  
**All you need is procedures, simple arithmetic with the comparisons, and "if" statement.**  
And this is a pretty amazing thing. This was shown by Alan Turing, back in the 1930s.

## Recap and Rest
###Recap
The previous video had a lot of good content about **procedural thinking**. In his second approach to finding the "biggest" number, Dave **used the function called bigger which he had written earlier**.  

This is an example of **one of the things that makes programming so amazing**. **Once you (or anyone else) has coded something once, you can use that thing again later as a tool!**  

### Rest
You're almost done with the lesson, but if you're feeling at all tired then now would be a good time to take a little break. Walk around, go outside, talk about what you're learning with someone else, or maybe try to teach a friend or family member something about programming.  

The rest of the lesson will introduce **while loops** which will let you write code that **does the same thing over and over**.
