## Practice with Dave
Next, Dave will ask you to write a function that adds the letter U to the beginning of strings. This is just meant to give you another chance at defining a function with the proper syntax. Some things to keep in mind:

### On the first line of your function definition...
- You must begin the line with **def** (lowercase).
- After def you must give a **function name** (in this case it will be udacify.
- Next, you must have **a set of parentheses** with the **required parameters** inside.
- The line must end with a** : colon**.

### In the body of the function
- Every line in the function must **be indented**.  
- If you want your function to produce output, it must end with a **return** statement.

### To "call" the function...
"Calling" a function just means using it. You do this by writing:

- The **function name**, followed by...
- ...an **open paren (**, followed by...
- ...the **values for the required parameters**, followed by...
- ...a **closed paren )**.

### To display the results of a function call.
Don't forget to include the **print** command before you call your function if you want to display the result on your screen!
