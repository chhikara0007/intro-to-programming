# Work Session1

## Practice Debugging
This practice session will focus on debugging, which is one of the five ways programmers think. Python requires code be written with a very specific syntax. This means that small typos can lead to big problems!  

In each of the following exercises, you'll be given code. Sometimes the code will work and sometimes it won't. For each exercise, do the following:  

- Read through the code and try to predict what it is supposed to do.
- Make a guess about whether or not it will actually work.
- Without modifying the code yet, press the Test Run button.
- Observe the output that's displayed.
- If there's an error message, read through it.
- These error messages are usually very cryptic. That's okay. Go through each message and try to decipher what the actual problem was. If you can figure it out, fix the code and then press Test Run again.

HINT: It's often a good idea to start at the **last line** of the error message.

## Before You Continue
The purpose of the previous three exercises was to show you just how easy it is to write code that doesn't work.  

In the next lesson you will write more sophisticated code. As you add sophistication, you will also add more ways to make mistakes. And you will make mistakes.  

The trick to dealing with programming mistakes (called "bugs") is not to avoid making them entirely. That's impossible. The trick is to **develop a system for finding and fixing them**.  

Whether you know it or not, you're already developing a system. That system will continue to improve throughout the Nanodegree.
