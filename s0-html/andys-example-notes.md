## Andy's Example Notes

- ```<!-- This line is an HTML comment. -->```  Comments help PEOPLE read code. They are ignored by the computer. You should use comments to leave notes for yourself (and anyone else who might read your code later). 
- The ```<head>``` element contains information that won't be displayed on the page.   
- The ```<title>``` element normally sets the name of the browser tab (but in this example codepen's title overrides the title I set) 
- The ```<h1>``` tag stands for "heading 1". Heading tags go all the way up to ```<h6>```. Lower numbered headings indicate content that is more important.
