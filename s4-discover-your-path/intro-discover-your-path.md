# Intro - Discover Your Path
## The Paths of Programming
The world of programming can be a bit confusing. Many terms are often used interchangeably to describe a person who writes computer programs, such as “programmer,” “developer,” “coder,” or “software engineer.” There are definitely distinctions between these terms, but in this course we will be using the term “programmer” or “developer” to describe someone who writes code for a living.  

Of course there are many different paths you can take but in this course we will dive into four specific roles within programming. Here’s what you will be able to do by the end of this course:  

- Identify the skills a front-end developer uses on a daily basis, such as front-end programming languages and frameworks. You will recognize that any prior knowledge with programming concepts can be transferable to JavaScript, a primary front-end language.
- Differentiate the tools and skills a back-end programmer uses, such as databases, deployment tools, and back-end frameworks. You will learn that Python is only one of many languages you may use in back-end development, and you will be able to dive into other languages with confidence.
- Recognize the different tools and skills used by the two main types of mobile programmers: iOS programmers and Android programmers. You will learn the differences between the Android and iOS development platforms and be equipped to make the decision between starting as an Android programmer or as an iOS programmer.
- Comprehend the breadth of tasks that data analysts perform and the skills required to perform these tasks including: Python for data wrangling, D3.js for data visualizations, and R for statistical analysis.

In general, you will be able to describe the different roles each type of programmer has on a team and have a better idea of which path you want to pursue. There are so many paths within programming but just remember that the roles we present in this course are just a few places you can start! Even if you decide not to pursue a career in programming, developing programming skills can enhance your life in many ways.  

Next up, we will develop a learning strategy for adopting new skills that will help you as you continue on your programming journey!

## Learning Zones Theory (Senninger, 2000)
Learning something new is like embarking on a new journey. You must leave behind what is comfortable and familiar in order to learn and grow. It can be helpful to think about your process for learning through the perspective of three different Learning Zones.  

**The Safe Zone** - This is where concepts are familiar and we don't have to take any risks. The Safe Zone is important because it gives us a place to return and reflect on our current understanding. However, our potential for growth is limited in the Safe Zone because we are not challenged with unfamiliar concepts.  

**The Stretch Zone**- To grow we must leave our Safe Zone and explore a Learning Zone just beyond our secure environment. Only in the Learning Zone can we make new discoveries and slowly expand our Safe Zone. Entering the Learning Zone is a borderline experience. We feel we're exploring the edge of our abilities and our limits.  

**The Strain Zone**- Beyond our Stretch Zone is the Strain Zone where learning becomes difficult and is blocked by a sense of fear and frustration. Learning that is connected with negative emotions is memorized in a part of the human brain that we can access only in similar emotional situations. While learning is possible in the Strain Zone, most of our energy is used managing and controlling our anxiety.  

Importantly, these three zones differ for each person depending on the situation. We all have our own unique Safe Zone - Stretch Zone - Strain Zone. This is why learning in a community is incredibly valuable. **Others can be your bridge back from your Strain Zone to your Stretch Zone**.

## Programming in the Real World

I started realizing how the knowledge of programming can enhance different people's life.  
A restaurant owner is able to build his own website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to advertise his business online. He might even be able to use Python or Ruby to take customer orders.  
A program manager that works with software engineers, is able to understand the technical components of a project and analyze data.  
A teacher may be able to create a mobile app to remind his students about homework that's due the next day.  
Or an artist is able to put up a responsive portfolio online for clients to see.  
As a dancer, I realized that I needed a way to share my work with local dance companies. Onece I learned how to code, I created a website for my dance portfolio. http://georgiatoavis.com/dance.html
