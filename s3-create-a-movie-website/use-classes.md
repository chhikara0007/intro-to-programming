## What Is a Class?
Kunal notes, starting at 0:48, the following: "A class Turtle, much like a blueprint, contains certain pieces of information about a turtle: the turtle's size, its color, the fact that the Turtle can move forward..."

It would be more accurate to say that the class Turtle indicates the fact that it has a size and a color. Individual instances of the Turtle will contain information about their sizes and their colors.

## How to Download and Install the Twilio Package

### Preface
Twilio works in several countries (the United States, Australia, the UK, and others) but, currently, full support outside of North America and Europe is not guaranteed. A list of supported countries is available on Twilio's site. Note that you'll have to scroll down to the "**SMS Enabled Phone Numbers**" section.

## Background
In Python, developers usually use one of the two common utilities to automatically download, and setup the necessary folders and files: easy_install and pip.

easy_install comes with the setuptools Python library which comes standard with Python and pip comes with the pip library. easy_install and pip are executed in the terminal that can be used to install Python packages.
