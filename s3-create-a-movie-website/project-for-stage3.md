## Project Specification
By the end of this stage, you will be able to **use other people's existing code** in your own programming projects. You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

## Project Display Example
Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.  

The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.


## Project Submission
### How will I complete this project?
- If you haven't already, install Python
- Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
- Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
- To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
- Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
Get started with this helpful guide.

For this stage, you will need to submit a zip of your project files saved as movie_website.zip. Your zip should include three Python files: media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py. Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric.
