# Intro: Create a Movie Webiste
## What You'll Make
### What You'll Make
In this stage, you will learn how to use **other people's** code to save you time and effort. This will let you quickly **add powerful functionality (like embedded movies)** into your page of notes.

### Project Overview
At the end of this stage, you will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

## How You'll Make it
- Go through lessons 3.1-3.5b (immediately following this lesson.)
- As you go through the course, take notes (on paper, on a computer, anywhere). You will not be required to submit your notes in this stage, but it's a great practice to keep up!
- In lesson 3.4a, Kunal will walk you through getting started on this project.
- In the "Stage 3 Submit: Create a Movie Website" lesson you will find the project specifications and rubric.

If you work 10 hours per week, you can expect to spend 3 - 5 weeks on these lessons.  

If you haven't already, I recommend you download the starter code for this Nanodegree program here. These files will help you follow along and take notes during each lessson.
