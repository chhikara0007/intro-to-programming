# Introduction to Abstraction
## What to Expect
You are about to take one of, if not the best online courses I've ever taken. Since this one is designed for a new programmer, you'll be taking this course in its entirety and won't be seeing me too often.  

You also won't have any work sessions in between lessons. Kunal will walk you through several mini-projects, where you will get hands-on practice. At the end, you will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.
