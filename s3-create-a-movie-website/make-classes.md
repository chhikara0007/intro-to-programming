Is your code organized and professional? If you need an idea of how to format and style your code to look organized and professional, check out the Google Python Style Guide and the PEP-8 site.

## Using Predefined Class Variables
```__doc(/name/module)__ ```

```
import turtle
print turtle.Turtle.__doc__
```

Add some documentation, at the beginning of the class Movie.
Use triple codes, to define my documentation.(create documentation for multiple lines)

```
class Movie():
	"""This is class provides a way to sotre movie related information"""
```

## Fish, Salmon, Classes, and Objects
When I was learning Object Oriented Programming I remember being fascinated by the idea (especially the idea of inheritance) but struggling with all the vocabulary. But learning the vocabulary becomes really important when you actually want to use OOP in the code you write.  

The most important linguistic distinction is between Objects and Classes. The resource I want to share comes from a free online book called "Learn Python the Hard Way," which I definitely recommend you check out if you want to learn more about Python. The section I want you to read does a fantastic job explaining the difference between a Class and an Object and it uses a simple question to motivate the whole thing:  

What's the difference between a salmon and a fish?

## Documentation

When submitting your project, be sure to include a README file detailing how a user is to run your project (how to open the movie trailer website).

- Include information, such as, how do they get your code (download, etc.), are there any requirements? Are there any commands that need to be run in order to run your application?
- A good example to get you started (provided by a current student on the forum) is the README file for bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#quick-start
- While this example is a bit extensive, it gives you an idea of what the purpose of a README file would be. README files are great because when there are programs that have a lot of interconnecting files or are new, README files provide instructions to other users on how to run your program.
