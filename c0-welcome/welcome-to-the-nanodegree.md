# Welcome to the Nanodegree
## Student Handbook & Syllabus

### What can I learn
- 技术：learn to code（掌握一门技能）
- 思维：learn what it means to "think like a programmer"（我最感兴趣的，也是我这门课的关注点，希望用编程锻炼自己的思考方式）
- 作品：have your own web page and portfolio of programs you've built to prove it（有自己的作品感觉很帅啊，输出才是王道，以后想转行有作品也好说话呀）

### [Study Tips](http://blog.udacity.com/2014/09/top-study-tips-for-online-courses.html)
- Study for at least an hour everyday
- Every bit counts - use the mobile app
- Use quizzes to practice, practice, practice
	- Students who graduate Udacity courses tend to spend about the same amount of time working on quizzes as they do watching videos. 
- Try hard, try often, and you'll succeed
	- With each time you test or submit an answer, you have the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and become a better programmer.
	
### Support System
####  1. Forum
- Coaches do their best to ensure all content-related questions have answers within 24 hours.

##### How to ask good questions on the forums
- Provide context for everyone
	- Include url links to the course video or quiz
	- Explain your process, include secrrenshots if necessary
	- Include the error message
- Format your code using markdown
	- Put three backticks(`) on the line before your code starts and three more one the line after your code ends.

### [50% BACK](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree/50-back)

#### If I cancel my subscription and re-enroll, how many months will be eligible for this program?

If you cancel your subscription and re-enroll in a Nanodegree program, you will need to graduate within 12 months of **your most recent enrollment**. You are then eligible to receive 50% of tuition back from the enrollment period in which you graduated.

For example, if you enroll in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program in July and cancel your subscription after two months, then re-enroll in October and graduate in March 2016, you will be eligible to receive 50% back on your payments made from October through March, but not the payments months prior to canceling your subscription (July & August).

A large goal of this Nanodegree is to give you practice thinking like a computer programmer. Longtime programmers will often talk about how the programming thought process has helped them in other areas of their life, but what does it mean to "think like a programmer?" 

### 1. Procedural Thinking
Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.

It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards, but getting a computer to do that requires more thought. But once you've learned to think this way you'll find that computers can do it much faster.

### 2. Abstract Thinking
Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.

In this Nanodegree you will visit hundreds of Udacity web pages. It would be impractical for a programmer to specifically program each of these pages individually. The Udacity programmers used the power of what's called abstraction to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.

### 3. Systems Thinking
Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree.

### 4. Technological Empathy
"Technological empathy" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing.

A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the programming languages used to write them. It's almost impossible to program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how these tools work.

### 5. Debugging
Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.

When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake (also known as a "bug") somewhere in the computer code. Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming, every good programmer has a system for fixing them and that system usually looks something like this:

- Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)
- Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)
- Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)
- Fix the problem

- Anyone can Learn Anything.就像khan学院也说过类似的话。
- 一个不懂编程的人，要做无人车编程课程的助理，他就是用自己可以学会的信念，不也扛下来了么？不也学得很好吗？
- 三年前，他不会编程。现在他会了，其实也没有那么难。
- 况且，我现在还拥有他三年前希望他能拥有的好资源。就好像我那时候会觉得很羡慕现在要学编程的人，有太多优质的资源了，可以直接找世界一流的老师教自己，很酷。

## Your Learning Mindset

In order to be successful you'll need to be self-motivated to learn.   
This program will be challenging, and it may be tempting to take a long break or even stop when you get stuck.   
Students who persevere, are consistent, and seek out answers on their own are best suited to succeed.   
Reach out to your study team, attend office hours, ask questions in the forums, and never give up!
