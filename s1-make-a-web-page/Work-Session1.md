# Work Session 1

## Reflection
Reflecting on what you've learned helps you bridge the knowledge gap between how novices and experts think about this material.

### Summarize what you've learned
You should have a saved HTML file from the previous work session which contains your notes from lesson one.

- Open the HTML file you wrote and submitted during Stage 0 in a text editor. Read through it to remind yourself what you learned in lesson one. If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can download the file linked in the Supporting Materials section below.
- Review the previous lesson by going through your notes (or skimming through the lesson again).
- Try to **group related facts into big ideas** and then summarize **those ideas with a few sentences**. Add these ideas and summaries to your HTML.

## Learning by Example
The next two segments show you two examples of a web page. Though both look identical for now, the **structured** example will be **much easier to modify in the future**.

You can switch back and forth between the displayed page and the underlying HTML by pressing the buttons on the top left.

Browse these two examples and pay attention to how the ```<div>```s in the first example are used to **group related content**.
