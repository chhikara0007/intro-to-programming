## Tips
### [How do I auto-resize an image to fit a div container?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3029422/how-do-i-auto-resize-an-image-to-fit-a-div-container)
Do not apply an explicit width or height to the image tag. Instead, give it:

```
max-width:100%;
max-height:100%;
```

### [Center Align Elements](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp)
To horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use ```margin: auto;```

## Code Review
Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:

- **Use of Syntax**: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass **HTML validation and CSS validation tests**.  
	- IMPORTANT: Please read the Instructor Notes below for further instructions on HTML validation. 
- **Use of Logical HTML Structure**: Content that is **logically related should be grouped together within a container element** (like a ```<div>``` or ```<span>```). Additionally, all tags should be used for their **semantic purpose** (ex: don't use a ```<p>``` tag to make a headline).
- **Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling**: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. **Similar HTML elements should have the same class name. ** 
	- IMPORTANT: You MUST include a CSS file in your project submissions. We want you to practice linking CSS in your HTML. Simply using ```<style>``` tags is not sufficient enough to demonstrate your knowledge of linking CSS to your HTML file.
- **Use of Tags**: Page uses tags correctly. ```<p>``` for paragraphs. ```<h1>``` for main heading, etc.
- **Content Display**: Page display at least 1 image and some text.
