What Element Is Missing Something?
If there's an element (let's call it a but it could be body, div, head, or any other valid HTML element) missing an element that it should have inside of it (let's call it b), then enter a or <a> into the first box and b or <b> into the second box, where a and b correspond to the elements' names.

At 0:15 in the solution video It sounds like Jessica says "head elements". In fact there can be only one head element in an html page. Your CSS should be correct and validate without errors.
