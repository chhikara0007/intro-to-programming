## Why You'll Make It
Even if you aren't interested in building web pages, this project will be an important foundational learning experience for any programming you want to do in the future. From this stage, you will:

- Get an introduction to important ideas throughout all of programming like:
	- What it means to "write code"
	- Why programmers hate **unnecessary repetition**
	- How the code that programmers write can have structure and how computers read and understand that structure
	- The importance (and pain) of syntax requirements
- Build comfort with programming tools before learning a more powerful (and potentially challenging) programming language
- Experience the thrill of writing code to tell a computer what to do and then watching the computer actually do it

## Adding Useful Bookmarks
Isn't it frustrating when you can't find a specific website right when you need it in order to solve a problem?

Browser Bookmarks are a developer's best friend. As you progress through IPND, you'll come across useful resources. It's a great practice to bookmark these resources for future reference. We have included a great starter kit for bookmarks that will be useful throughout your journey in IPND.

Follow these easy steps to get your bookmarks imported to your browser:

- Step 1: Download the file IPND_bookmarks.zip from the Supplemental Materials
- Step 2: Navigate to the Bookmark Manager in your browser
- Step 3: Click the Organize dropdown menu, and select **Import Bookmarks From HTML File**...
- Step 4: Navigate to your downloaded file IPND_bookmarks.zip, unzip the file, select the IPND_bookmarks.html and click Open
- Step 5: Voila! Enjoy your brand new bookmark folders full of useful resources!

## Join the IPND Student Slack Community!
Slack is an amazing tool for you to connect directly with and learn from your Udacity coaches, fellow students, and graduates of the program. You can network, get support, and share ideas in real-time!

Feel free to post questions about the material, create your own channels, and get to know your fellow Intro to Programming students.

**introbot @Slack**  
This is ​*Slack*​, a realtime messaging app for teams. This is another resource for you to interact with your classmates and the Udacity team! **Community** is such an important part of the Intro to Programming ecosystem, and this can be a great place for you to practice ​**asking for help**​ and ​**collaborating**​ with others. Slack is a tool that you’ll probably be using in the workplace. It’s especially common at software companies nowadays. In fact, you may already be using it at your current job!

Everyone has a goal in mind when they make the commitment to taking a nanodegree. At Udacity, we want you to remember it. Type in what made you decide to take this nanodegree like this: `goal: I'm taking this nanodegree because I want to learn what programming is.` You ​*must*​ begin your goal with `goal:`. So what's your goal with taking this nanodegree?
