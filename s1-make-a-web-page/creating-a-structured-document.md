## Why Start With HTML and CSS
- Front-end web development is a lot of fun.
- It's one of the few areas of programming that is just inherently **visual**. Anything you do, any code you write, any changes you make, will automaticaly be visible inside a browsers.
- With web development, it's really **easy to share** a website with somebody. So it's a fantastic place to not just **get immediate feedback** on the code that you're writing, but also give you a chance to **share what you're doing**.

## The First Step
- Website - a house
- HTML files - the structure where the wall's placed (What room is your livingroom?)
- CSS files - the style of your house (What color are the walls?)
- JavaScript files - interactive components that changing some element of your house (television remote)

## Exploring the Web
- Google Chrome -> Tools -> **Developer Tools**
- Though some elements are invisible (like the 'head' element), all visible elements are **rectangular**.

### Learn More
Throughout your Nanodegree program, you'll have the chance to go deeper into concepts through **live events** where you can **ask questions** and get answers straight from your coaches. The details to signup and attend are shared in your forum.

Can't attend live? Don't worry! We also record sessions so you can watch them anytime. We will be sharing the recordings of past events in nodes like this one.

These sessions cover things like **common mistakes** coaches notice students making, **additional practice** of specific skills, or even just clarification of program details and discussion of how students are feeling about their experience.

## Focus Checkpoint
Be prepared, the next video is 3 mins long but goes over a lot.

You don't need to remember or follow every point made in this video (but you should feel free to re-watch it if you want). The important things to take away from this are:

- HTML and CSS are both "languages"
- HTML controls the **"structure"** of a web page
- CSS controls the **"style"** of a page (how it looks).
- When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the **tree-like structure of a page**.

To learn more about what a "tree-like structure" means, read the first two paragraphs of the [wikipedia article on Tree Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure).

## HTML-CSS-DOM

- HTML - HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.
- CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
- DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.

## How to Listen to Experts
You're about to watch an interview with Jacques, a professional programmer who works at Udacity. When you're a novice (in anything, but especially with programming), it can be difficult to communicate with experts.

That's because experts are so familiar with their field that they've forgotten what it was like to get there. This often means that experts will:

- assume you have knowledge that you don't
- use jargon you don't understand
- speak too quickly for you to understand.

When people do this, remember that they probably aren't trying to confuse you or show off. They have usually just forgotten how hard it was for them when they were learning the same thing. In these situations, **don't be afraid to ask questions even if they seem basic**. The person you're talking to will probably be excited to talk about anything in their field if someone is willing to listen.

Luckily, Jacques does a good job of avoiding "expert blind spot." As he speaks, listen to the **technological empathy** he has! When he sees a picture, he immediate **sees it the way a browser sees HTML: as boxes within boxes within boxes...**

This kind of expertise takes lots and lots of practice to develop. But if you enjoy this sort of thing, you may want to check out Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree when you're done with this one.
