## Reflection
Reflecting on what you've learned helps you bridge the knowledge gap between how novices and experts think about this material.

### Summarize What You've Learned
You should have a saved HTML file from the previous work session which contains your notes from lessons one and two.

- Read through the HTML file you've been working on to remind yourself what you learned in the first two lessons.
- Review lesson 3 by going through your notes (or skimming through the lesson again).
- Try to group related facts from lesson 3 into big ideas and then summarize those ideas with a few sentences. Add these ideas and summaries to your HTML.

## Practice

Practicing what you've learned helps you bridge the skills gap between what novices and experts are able to do.

### Apply What You've Learned
This is the last work session for stage one. After this you'll be submitting your final project for Stage 1, your own personal webpage. So let's get started!

Download the stage1.zip file. Unzip the file by double-clicking it. You'll get your two project files, an HTML file named index.html and a CSS file named style.css. Open both in your text editor.

Your project is to **create a webpage about anything you'd like**, using all of the concepts you've learned thus far including:

- Using HTML tags like <b>, <p>, <h1> to structure your page
- Styling your page using CSS class selectors
- Adding images to your page by referencing local files on your computer or online files via a URL

Your web page can be about **anything you'd like**! Be creative! Here are some ideas:

- Expand your **notes page** from Stage 0, this time with style!
- Create an **"About Me"** page that you can share with others
- Make a list of **your favorite baseball players** with their stat lines
- Compile **a playlist** by linking to songs on Spotify or YouTube

These are all things you can already do with the knowledge you have. Up next in "Stage 1 Submit: Make a Web Page" you'll see the Project Specification for this project along with a rubric that will show you how you'll be graded. Make sure to read these thoroughly before you submit!

If you need help completing this project, feel free to reach out on the Discussion Forums, schedule a 1:1 coaching appointment, or attend an office hours session.
