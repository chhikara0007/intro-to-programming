			    <p>HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages). HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. A markup language is a set of markup tags. HTML documents are described by HTML tags. Each HTML tag describes different document content.</p>

			    	<b>Computers Are Stupid</b>
			    </p>
			    <p>Computers interpret language <em>literally</em>. Computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity, but sometimes this can result in issues between the programmer and the machine.</p>

			    </p>
			    <p>New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts. But programming doesn't work like that! Instead, <em>you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them.</em>there's lots of resources to help you out.<a href="http://www.google.com">Google search</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> are usually helpful.</p>

			    	<b>Why Start With HTML and CSS</b>
			    </p>
			    <p>It's one of the few areas of programming that is just inherently <em>visual</em>. Anything you do, any code you write, any changes you make, will automaticaly be visible inside a browsers.With web development, it's really <em>easy to share</em> a website with somebody. So it's a fantastic place to not just get immediate feedback on the code that you're writing, but also give you a chance to share what you're doing.</p>
