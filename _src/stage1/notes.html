			    	<p>It's one of the few areas of programming that is just inherently <b>visual</b>. Anything you do, any code you write, any changes you make, will automaticaly be visible inside a browsers.With web development, it's really <b>easy to share</b> a website with somebody. So it's a fantastic place to not just get immediate feedback on the code that you're writing, but also give you a chance to share what you're doing.</p>
